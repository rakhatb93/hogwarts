     <h1>My adventures in Europe</h1>
     
     <h2>In May 2019 I took a trip to Europe where I visited some of the most spectacular cities. Here is my diary on the trip</h2>
     
     <h2>Trip route and schedule</h2>
     <blockquote>
     <p>During my trip I visited four European cities which are the following:</p>

     <table>
         <tr>
            <th>City</th>
            <th>Country</th>

     Day 1, 19.05.2019
     </blockquote>
     
     <p>On May 18th I took a flight from Astana, Kazakhstan to Budapest, Hungary. The plane<br>
     landed in the capital of Hungary nearly at midnight that's why I count May 19th as the first day.<br>
     I was going to take a bus to Vienna at 6 in the morning, by the prominent European bus company <a href="Flixbus.html"><q>Flixbus</q></a>,<br> 
     so I'd decided not to book a hostel for a few
     but take a long walk around the city as I was waiting for the bus.</p>
